An Implementation of a `hash table` that stores words (strings).


Hash Table Dictionary

A hash table class called `HashTable` to store standard strings composed of lower-case letters. 
Collisions are handled using double hashing.


Public Methods

`default constructor `- creates a hash table of default size: 101; sets all array elements to the empty string (""); 
                        sets the value used by h2

`constructor` - creates a hash table to store n items where the value of n is given by the constructor's single 
                integer parameter, the size of the underlying array should be the smallest prime number equal to or greater than 2n; sets all array elements to the empty string; sets the value used by h2

`copy constructor` - a constructor that creates a deep copy of its HashTable reference parameter

`destructor` - de-allocates any dynamic memory associated with the calling object

`operator=` - overloads the assignment operator for HashTable objects ï¿½ makes the calling object a deep copy of its 
                HashTable reference parameter; returns a reference to the calling object

`insert` - searches the hash table for the method's string parameter, if a matching string is not found it inserts the 
            parameter string into the hash table; if the hash table's load factor is greater then 0.67 after insertion (1) creates a new hash table of size equal to the first prime number greater than twice the size of the original table, (2) inserts the original contents in the new table at the appropriate places and (3) sets the value used by h2

`find` - returns true if its string parameter is in the hash table, returns false if it is not

`size` - returns the number of items stored in the hash table

`maxSize` - returns the size of the hash table's underlying array

`loadFactor` - returns the load factor of the hash table as a double

Private Methods and Attributes

    S - string* to refer to the underlying array of string objects
    max_sz - int to record the size of the underlying array
    p2_distance - int to record the value used by h2
    current_size - int to record the current number of items in the hash table




Hash Function

    Insertions are mapped to array indexes using the function: string_value % array_size. 
    To achieve this your function must first generate the integer string_value from a given string. This value is calculated by assigning the values 1 to 26 to the letters a to z (regardless of letter case) and calculating a unique value for each string by multiplying each character's value by 32 letter position. A string of length n therefore has the following value:

    ch0 * 32n-1 + ch1 * 32n-2 + ... + chn-2 * 321 + chn-1 * 320
    Where ch0 is the left most character of the string and n is the size of the string. For example, the string "cat" has this value:

    3 * 322 + 1 * 32 + 20 = 3,124
    
    To find the integer corresponding to a lower-case character at position i in a string str subtract 96 from the character:
        int asc = str[i] - 96; //ASCII a = 97

    words must consist of lowercase letters

`Second Hash Function for Collisions`

    The hash function to determine the distance to move from the initial index in the event of a collision is generated by h2: p2_distance % (string_value % p2_distance)
    where string_value is an integer representation of the string (discussed above) and p2_distance is the first prime number greater than array_size / 2. 


`SpellCheck`

    Each function in `spellcheck.h` checks to see if its input string is in a given dictionary and, 
    if not, returns an ordered list of words in the dictionary that is similar to its input, as determined by the function's process. 

    vector<string> functionName(const HashTable & dict, string word)
    where dict contains the dictionary and word is a string composed solely of lowercase letters.

There are three possible return values for each of the functions.

    success - if word parameter is in dict the result should contain word, and no other strings.

    near-miss - if word is not in dict but dict contains strings similar to word, as determined by the function. the 
                    result should contain these near-misses in order.

    failure - if word is not in dict and dict contains no strings similar to word, as determined by the function, the
                result should be empty.

Functions

    extraLetter - if word is not in dict returns all strings in dict that can be made by deleting a single letter from word

    transposition - if word is not in dict returns all strings in dict that can be made swapping any two adjacent letters in word

    missingSpace - if word is not in dict returns all pairs of strings in dict that can be made by inserting a single space in word; each string in the result should consist of the two strings from dict separated by a space

    missingLetter - if word is not in dict returns all strings in dict that can be made by inserting any single letter of the alphabet at any position in word

    incorrectLetter - if word is not in dict returns all strings in dict  that can be made by changing any single letter of word to a different letter in the alphabet

Examples

`extraLetter` - input: chate, output: {chat, hate} - not hat or cat as they have two fewer letters

`transposition` - input: atr, output: {tar, art} - not rat as that requires swapping more than two adjacent letters

`missingSpace` - input: rateat, output: {rat eat, rate at}

`missingLetter` - input: poe, output: {poet, poke, pole, pope, pose} - not poetry as it has more than one missing 
                    letter

`incorrectLetter` - input: thed, output: {shed, thee, them, they, thud, toed} - not shad or thus as they have two 
                    incorrect letters
