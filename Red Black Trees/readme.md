Red Black Tree Class

Implementation of a `Red-black tree` template class to store data of any (comparable) type.


`More About Red-Black Trees`

    Its almost like the normal binary search tree data structure. But for keeping the tree balanced, nodes are assigned a colour.

`Red-Black trees`  mantain the following properties:

    Every node is either red or black.
    The root is black.
    Every null node is black. (null nodes are the leaf nodes)
    If a node is red, both of its children are black. This means no two nodes on a path can be red nodes.
    Every path from a root node to a null node has the same number of black nodes.
